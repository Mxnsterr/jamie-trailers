#Standalone script for JustJamie's Drift server

## Installation info:
1) Drop jamie-menu, jamie-trailers and PolyZone in [gamemodes]
2) Drop money.lua in driftV -> client -> playerStuff
3) Start jamie-menu, jamie-trailers and PolyZone in your server.cfg

## Info
- Used qb-menu and made it standalone so no credits go to me for that. 
- money.lua is just a export function
- PolyZone is a resource so you can check if a player is in a certain zone, possible you already have it
